Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to harbor life. It formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago.

Earthquakes are sudden shaking movements of the Earth's surface caused by the movement of tectonic plates. They occur when stress builds up along fault lines and is suddenly released.

Water is a transparent, odorless, and tasteless liquid that is essential for all known forms of life. Unlike lava, which is molten rock from volcanic activity, water has a chemical formula of H2O and freezes at 0Â°C.

The Moon experiences moonquakes, which are seismic events similar to earthquakes but much weaker. These occur due to tidal forces from Earth and thermal expansion and contraction.

Earth's structure consists of several layers: the crust (outermost layer), mantle (hot rock layer), outer core (liquid iron and nickel), and inner core (solid iron and nickel).

The Earth's atmosphere is composed of approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases including carbon dioxide and argon.

Earth's magnetic field protects the planet from harmful solar radiation and is generated by the movement of molten iron in the outer core.

Photons are fundamental particles of light and electromagnetic radiation. They are massless particles that travel at the speed of light and carry energy and momentum. Photons are involved in all electromagnetic interactions and are responsible for the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature.
